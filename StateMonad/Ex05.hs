-- Task 1. Eight Queens on a Chessboard

-- The queen â™› is the most powerful piece in the game of chess.
-- Chess is played on an 8x8 checkerboard: each square of the board
-- is labeled by a horizontal and a vertical coordinate ranging from
-- 0 to 7.
--
-- When a queen is placed in one of the squares, it is able to
-- threaten any number of squares vertically, horizontally or
-- diagonally (corner-by-corner) along a straight line.
--
-- For example, the queen Q placed at (1,1) below is able to threaten
-- all the `#` squares, but not the `-` squares.
--
--  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
--0 # # # - - - - -
--1 # Q # # # # # #
--2 # # # - - - - -
--3 - # - # - - - -
--4 - # - - # - - -
--5 - # - - - # - -
--6 - # - - - - # -
--7 - # - - - - - #
--
-- The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess
-- queens on the checkerboard in such a way that no two of the
-- queens threaten each other's location.
--
-- In a valid solution of the eight queens problem, no two
-- queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. Since there
-- are eight columns, each column must therefore contain exactly
-- one queen.
--
-- Thus, we will represent our solution as a list `[Int]`
-- of positions: the first entry of the list tells us the location
-- (a row between 0 and 7) of the queen in column 0,
-- the second entry the location of the queen in column 1, and so on.
--
-- A list of length less than 8 denotes a partial solution, where
-- queens were only placed in the first few columns.

type Row = Int
type Queens = [Row] -- position of queen in each column

-- 1.a. Implement a function `extend` that takes a single partial solution
--      containing `n` queens in the first `n` columns, and
--      returns a list of all valid extensions of the partial
--      solution by adding a new queen to the `n+1`st column.
--      If there are no such extensions, the function should return [].
--      HINT 1: write a function that determines safe and threatened
--              row positions in the column.
--      HINT 2: you may want to use the list monad.

-- Task 2. RPN calculator
-- Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a way of writing arithmetic
-- expressions without parentheses. Apart from the lack
-- of parentheses, its main advantage is that it's easy
-- to type into a calculator.
--
-- Handheld RPN calculators were very popular throughout the 80s,
-- and some people still swear by them.
--
-- Generally, evaluation on an RPN calculator proceeds by maintaining
-- a stack of numbers, and handling each user action one at a time.
-- 1. If the user entered a number (e.g. action `Enter 5`),
--    we push the entered number onto a stack.
-- 2. If the user pressed the button for an arithmetic operation,
--    say `+`, we remove the two topmost number `x` and `y` from
--    the stack, and put the result, (in this case `y + x`) on
--    the stack.
-- 3. There are special buttons: `Clear`, which, when pressed, removes
--    the topmost number from the stack; `AllClear`, which removes
--    everything from the stack, and `Swap`, which swaps the two
--    topmost elements on the stack.

-- Old calculators could store only 4-5 elements on their stack.
-- Here, we allow our stack to be an unbounded list of numbers.
-- The bottom of the stack is always padded with zeroes:
-- so the stack `[]` and the stack `[0,0]` behave identically,
-- as the stacks `[5,4]` and `[5,4,0]` behave identically as well.

-- As an example, the following sequence of actions:
-- `[Enter 3, Enter 7, Enter 5, Arith (-), Arith (*)]`
-- will result in the following final stack state: [6].
-- First, 3, 7 and 5 are put on the stack. Then we subtract
-- 5 from 7, leaving 3 and 2 on the stack. Finally, we multiply
-- these two, which yields 6.
